# 🍽️ Odin Recipes
Welcome to **Odin Recipes**, a beginner web development project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This project focuses on building a basic recipe website using only **HTML**.

## 📌 Project Desciption
The goal of this project is to create a simple multi-page website that showcases a collection of recipes. 

It includes a main homepage and individual recipe pages that contain:

- Titles and headings: A recipe title
- Paragraphs: A description/ Step-by-step cooking instructions
- Images
- Ordered and unordered lists: Ingredients list
- Internal links: Links to multiple recipe pages

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
This project helps reinforce knowledge by completing it, and will demonstrated the ability to:
- Structure a website using HTML: Basic HTML structure
- Link between multiple pages using relative paths: Anchor tags and linking between pages
- Use semantic HTML elements correctly
- Embed and display images on a webpage: Image embedding
- Organize content using lists and headings: Lists and headings

## 🪞 Self-Reflection
(Complete this section after finishing the project)
> This project helped reinforce the foundational skills of HTML. I gained confidence in creating and linking multiple HTML pages, structuring content with semantic tags, and working with basic file organization. It's a great stepping stone before moving on to CSS and JavaScript.
